You're building a founder-friendly Web3 VC directory that is:

✅ Free
✅ Public
✅ Non-bookable
✅ Time-saving shortcut for lazy or busy founders to browse all Web3 VCs in one clean view
✅ SEO-attractive so it brings cold traffic from Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google

🔥 New Messaging & UX Goals
This page is not part of your Ping Me booking funnel. It’s an open-access utility — a value-first tool to:

“Save founders hours of searching by listing all Web3-focused VCs in one clean, searchable place.”

So think: lightweight Crunchbase for Web3 VCs — but sexy.

✅ What the Directory Page Should Include
For each VC:

Field	Description
Name	VC or angel name
Fund	Affiliation if relevant
Stage	(e.g., Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A)
Geo	Optional (e.g., Global, US, Asia)
Focus	(e.g., DeFi, Infra, Consumer)
Twitter / Website	Public links only
✅ No contact info, no bookings — just info browsing
