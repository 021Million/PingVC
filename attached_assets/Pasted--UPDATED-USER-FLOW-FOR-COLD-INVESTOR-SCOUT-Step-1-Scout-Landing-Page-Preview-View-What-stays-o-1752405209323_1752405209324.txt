 UPDATED USER FLOW FOR COLD INVESTOR SCOUT
🔹 Step 1: Scout Landing Page (Preview View)
What stays on the main /cold-scout page:

Fund Name (e.g., Paradigm, a16z)

Mini Description (e.g., “Crypto-native fund backing early-stage infra”)

Fund Website Link (🌐 icon)

“View Details” button — this replaces the list of decision makers here

Optional: Keep the 🔥 “Cold Scout” badge

👉 This page should NOT show decision makers or unlock buttons anymore.

🔹 Step 2: Fund Detail Page (Expanded View)
When a user clicks "View Details", they are routed to /cold-scout/[fund-name] which includes:

Full Fund Profile

Fund Name

Full description

Website link

Investment thesis

Sectors

Stages

Decision Makers Section (Below Fund Info)

Roles visible (e.g., “Partner”, “Co-Founder”)

Names + social links = blurred or hidden

Each decision maker has:

🔒 "Unlock for $1" button

Unlock reveals Name + LinkedIn + X profile
