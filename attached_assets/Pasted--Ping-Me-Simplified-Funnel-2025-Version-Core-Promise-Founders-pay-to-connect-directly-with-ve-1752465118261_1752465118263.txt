🎯 Ping Me — Simplified Funnel (2025 Version)
Core Promise:
Founders pay to connect directly with verified VCs and Angels. No spam. Just results.

🧭 Funnel Overview (3 Core Steps)
Step	Page / Flow	Goal
1. Landing Page	GET /	Explain the value & get them to click "Browse VCs"
2. VC Marketplace	GET /vcs	Let them browse profiles, pricing, tags
3. VC Profile Page	GET /vc/:id	Unlock contact or book a call via Stripe

Everything else is optional or secondary.

🔹 2. Investor Marketplace (/vcs)
Goal: Show credibility + pricing. Get click-through to profile.

Layout:

Grid of cards (photo, name, tags, fund, price)

Filter by tag or stage

Each card links to: /vc/:id

🔹 3. VC Profile (/vc/:id)
Goal: Sell the investor & convert the user.

Layout:

VC Name + Photo + Fund

“About this Investor” bio

Tags (Stage, Focus)

Price to unlock contact / book

CTA: “Connect for $X”

On click → Stripe Checkout → Success → show email/calendly

🧱 Backend Simplification
Drop unnecessary routes like:

Scout listing

Founder profile builder

Cold DM directory

Only keep:

js
Copy
Edit
/app.post('/api/enter')          // Email gate (optional)
/app.get('/api/vcs')             // Fetch all verified VCs
/app.get('/api/vc/:id')          // Fetch 1 VC profile
/app.post('/api/unlock-vc')      // Stripe checkout to unlock
🧠 Copywriting Tone (Miss AI x Greg Isenberg style)
Be crisp, smart, a little cheeky

You’re speaking to time-poor founders and polished investors

Connect with verified investors. Skip the dance.

💥 Pay once. Get direct contact. No gatekeepers.

🧰 Tools to Keep
Stripe Checkout + Connect (you already have this ✅)

Minimal session storage / db (Airtable or Supabase) to track who unlocked what

(Optional) Email collector before unlock or Calendly redirect

🔥 MVP Flow Recap
Founder lands → clicks “Browse VCs”

Sees grid → clicks profile

Sees price → pays via Stripe

Gets contact email or Calendly

(Optionally) ping sent to investor + confirmation email
